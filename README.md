## Description:

The primary goal of this project is to provide a hands-on experience with sorting algorithms in the C programming language. Participants will implement and compare various sorting algorithms, gaining insights into their strengths, weaknesses, and time complexities. Additionally, the project explores the concept of Big O notation, a tool used to describe the efficiency of algorithms in terms of their worst-case scenario.

## Sorting Algorithms:

The project includes implementations of the following sorting algorithms:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort

Each algorithm is implemented as a separate module, allowing users to easily compare their performance and characteristics.

## Big O Notation:

Understanding the time complexity of algorithms is crucial for analyzing their efficiency as the input size grows. The project includes explanations and examples of Big O notation, helping participants grasp the concept and apply it to the sorting algorithms implemented.

## Project Structure:

The project is structured as follows:

```
0x1B-sorting_algorithms/
|-- 0-bubble_sort.c
|-- 1-insertion_sort_list.c
|-- 2-selection_sort.c
|-- 3-quick_sort.c
|-- README.md
```

- Each sorting algorithm has its own C file in the root directory.
- The `main` directory contains test cases to validate the correctness and performance of each sorting algorithm.
